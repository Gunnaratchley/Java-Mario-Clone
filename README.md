# Java-Mario-Clone
Small clone of mario with little implementation
Map is auto loaded with 2 tubes and a goomba. 
Collision detection works between goombas and tubes allowing them to bounce back and forth.
Mario also collides with tubes as expected.
Pressing 't' will allow you to click to add or remove tubes.
Pressing 'g' will allow you to click to add or remove goombas.
Pressing 's' will save the map to a Json object
Pressing 'q' will quit the game.
Functionality is currently limited at the moment and is still a work in progress.
